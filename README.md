# House-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning project to predict house prices using Linear Regression.

# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on property features such as living area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using Linear Regression.

The objective is to apply regression techniques on a real-world dataset and evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
